## Initial Response to an Offer

### When Asked About Salary Expectations Before an Offer

**Strategy:** Politely deflect and gather more information.

**If pressed further:**
"Based on my research and experience, roles like this typically range from [lower end] to [higher end]. However, I'm considering the entire compensation package, including benefits and growth opportunities. I'm confident we can arrive at a package that reflects my value to your team if we're the right match."

### When Receiving an Initial Offer

**Strategy:** Express appreciation, ask for time to consider, and avoid accepting immediately.

**Script:**
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the opportunity to join [Company Name] and contribute to [specific company initiative or goal]. I appreciate you sharing this information.

### Opening the Discussion

**Strategy:** Begin with enthusiasm and appreciation before introducing negotiation.

### Making Your Counter-Offer

**Strategy:** Provide specific justification based on your research, experience, and value.

**Script:**
"Based on my [X years of experience], specialized skills in [relevant skills], and the market rate for similar roles, I was hoping for a base salary closer to [specific amount]. My research indicates that this is in line with the industry standard for someone with my qualifications and the impact I expect to make in this position."

**For a low initial offer:**
"I appreciate the offer of [initial amount]. Given my experience in [specific relevant experience] and demonstrated success in [specific achievement], I was expecting a salary in the range of [your target]. My research shows this is consistent with market rates for professionals with my background in this industry. How can we work together to bridge this gap?"

### Negotiating Beyond Base Salary

**Strategy:** Consider the full compensation package if base salary has limited flexibility.

**Script:**
"I understand there may be constraints on the base salary. I'm wondering if we could explore other elements of the compensation package to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. For example, would it be possible to discuss [sign-on bonus/performance bonus/additional equity/professional development budget/flexible work arrangements]?"

### "We don't have any more budget for this role."

**Strategy:** Explore creative alternatives and non-monetary benefits.

**Script:**
"I appreciate that budget constraints can be challenging. Perhaps we could discuss a performance review after 6 months instead of the standard annual review, with the potential for a salary adjustment based on my contributions? Alternatively, would it be possible to consider [additional vacation days/flexible work arrangements/professional development opportunities] to enhance the overall package?"

### "We need your decision by tomorrow."

**Strategy:** Maintain professionalism while requesting reasonable time.

**Script:**
"I understand you're eager to finalize the hiring process. This is an important decision for both of us, and I want to ensure I'm fully committed when I join your team. Would it be possible to have until [specific date, typically 2-3 days later] to make my decision?

## Key Negotiation Principles to Remember

1. **Maintain a positive, collaborative tone throughout**
   * View negotiation as problem-solving rather than confrontation
   * Express genuine enthusiasm for the role and company

2. **Focus on your value, not your needs**
   * Frame requests in terms of your contributions, not personal circumstances
   * Use specific examples of past achievements as evidence

3. **Consider the full package, not just base salary**
   * Evaluate benefits, bonuses, equity, retirement contributions, time off, etc.
   * Different elements may have different values to you versus the company

4. **Be prepared to walk away if necessary**
   * Know your minimum acceptable offer before negotiations begin
   * Having a BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) strengthens your position

5. **Get the final offer in writing**
   * Ensure all negotiated terms are documented in your offer letter
   * Clarify any ambiguous terms before accepting

Remember that successful negotiation creates value for both parties. When you negotiate thoughtfully and professionally, you set a positive tone for your future employment relationship.
